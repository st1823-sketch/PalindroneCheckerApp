# Palindrome Checker App

## Introduction
The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "madam" or "racecar").

This project is structured to demonstrate core Java programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

## Features
- **UC1: Welcome Message:** Professional console-based startup interface.
- **Case Sensitivity (Planned):** Options to check palindromes with or without case sensitivity.
- **Special Character Handling (Planned):** Logic to ignore spaces and punctuation.

## Technical Concepts Applied
* **Classes & Objects:** Logical grouping of application behavior.
* **Static Methods:** Using `main()` for direct JVM invocation.
* **String Manipulation:** Utilizing Java's String API for sequence analysis.
* **Flow Control:** Managing application lifecycle from startup to exit.

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Compilation
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
javac UseCase1PalindromeCheckerApp.java
