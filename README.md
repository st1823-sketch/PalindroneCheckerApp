# Palindrome Checker App

## Introduction
The **Palindrome Checker App** is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "madam" or "racecar").

This project is structured to demonstrate core Java programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

## Features
- **UC1: Welcome Message:** Professional console-based startup interface.
- **Case Sensitivity (Planned):** Options to check palindromes with or without case sensitivity.
- **Special Character Handling (Planned):** Logic to ignore spaces and punctuation.

## Technical Concepts Applied
* **Classes & Objects:** Logical grouping of application behavior.
* **Static Methods:** Using `main()` for direct JVM invocation.
* **String Manipulation:** Utilizing Java's String API for sequence analysis.
* **Flow Control:** Managing application lifecycle from startup to exit.

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Compilation
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
javac PalindromeCheckerApp.java

# Palindrome Checker App - UC2

## Objective
To design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.

## Key Concepts Applied
* **Class & Main Method**: Standard entry point for Java applications.
* **String Manipulation**: Using `.length()` and `.charAt()` to traverse text.
* **Control Flow**: `for` loop for reversing and `if-else` for comparison.

## Execution Instructions

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Compile the program:**
    ```bash
    javac PalindromeCheckerApp.java
    ```
3.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    java PalindromeCheckerApp
    ```

## Expected Output
```text
Original String: madam
Reversed String: madam
Result: The string is a palindrome.
