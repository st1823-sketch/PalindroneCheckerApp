# UC8: Linked List-Based Palindrome Checker

## 📌 Project Overview
The **UC8 Palindrome Checker App** is a Java console application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome using a **Singly Linked List**.

Unlike the deque-based approach, this implementation demonstrates advanced **data structure manipulation** including **in-place reversal** and **fast/slow pointer technique**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts user input from console
- Ignores spaces
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Uses **Singly Linked List**
- Optimized comparison by reversing the second half of the list
- Restores the original linked list after the check

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- `java.util.Scanner`
- Custom **Node** and **LinkedList** classes
